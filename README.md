# TinyMarkup
A super-compact JSON like file format, that reads nested strings and can traverse a hierarcichal structure.
Useful for use cases where you want to setup a data structure with some simple/specific rules and control is a higher priority than standard JSON.

## License
Simple class and implementation, setup with the most permissive license options.
